                    <p>How come you're always such a fussy young man. Don't want no Cap'n Crunch.  Don't want no Raisin Bran.  Well, don't you know that other kids are starvin' in Japan.  So eat it, just eat it.  Don't want to argue. I don't want to debate.  Don't want to hear about what kinds of foods you hate. You won't get no dessert 'till you clean off you're plate.  So eat it.</p>
                    <p>Don't you tell me you're full. Just eat it. Eat it. Get yourself an egg and beat it. Have some more chicken. Have some more pie.  It doesn't matter. If it's boiled or fried, just eat it.  Just eat it. Just eat it.  Just eat it. Woo! </p>
                    <p>Your table manners are a crying shame. You're playing with your food, this ain't some kind of game.  Now, if you starve to death. You'll just have yourself to blame.  So eat it. Just eat it.  You betterâ€¦</p>
